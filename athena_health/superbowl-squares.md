Problem Statement

There are two teams playing a game. The game lasts five rounds. A round consists of each team taking a turn. During their turn, a team scores points according to the following distribution:

Points	Probability
0	.5
1	.3
2	.2
We want to figure out the 10-most likely outcomes (probabilities of the possible (pairs of) scores for the two teams at the end of the game) and their probabilities.

Answer

Outcome	Probability
3-3	0.047306
3-4	0.044642
4-3	0.044642
4-4	0.042128
2-3	0.038063
3-2	0.038063
2-4	0.035919
4-2	0.035919
3-5	0.031849
5-3	0.031849
